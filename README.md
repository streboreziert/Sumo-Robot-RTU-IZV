# Sumo-Robot-RTU-IZV
The project is programming a sumo robot based on MicroPython to participate in the RTU Sumo Robot battle by the end of the 2023/2024 school year.

Objectives until April 4th:

Implement Fast Charging with Type-C Connector:
1.1. Develop a new chip for controlling battery charging using MicroPython.
1.2. Enhance the existing library in the ESP32 processor using C++ to improve voltage tracking for fast charging.

Code UV Sensors for Color Differentiation and Field Border Tracking:
 2.1 Develop code for UV sensors to differentiate colors and track field borders for the robot.
Implement WiFi Control over ESP32 Processor:

3.1. Incorporate ESP8266EX on the PCB for WiFi capabilities.
3.2. Develop an application for phone or Windows to communicate with the chip.
3.3. Enhance WiFi connection control in all existing code for sumo robots. This includes:
- Ensuring robust WiFi connectivity between the robot and external devices.
- Implementing error handling and reconnection mechanisms for uninterrupted operation.
- Optimizing WiFi configurations for power efficiency and reliability.
- Testing and debugging the WiFi control extensively to ensure seamless integration with other functionalities.
